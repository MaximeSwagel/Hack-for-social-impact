PS5 — CHYP: Human-Centered AI Intake System

0) TL;DR (Phase 1 scope)

Build a small, safe, high-precision scraper that discovers and classifies housing-related resources in San Francisco for homeless youth. Output a clean, deduplicated JSON catalog with metadata ready for downstream search, chat, and intake form-filling.

1) Problem & Users

Problem: Youth must navigate fragmented, repetitive, trauma-insensitive intake systems across agencies. Links exist, but are hard to find, understand, or trust.

Primary users: Youth (13–24), caregivers, outreach workers; secondarily, cross-system providers (gov + nonprofits).

Phase 1 objective: Seed a trustworthy SF Housing directory (links + structured metadata) that later plugs into an AI intake assistant.

Our first objective is to create a live queryable database with he different housing providers for youth homeless in SF.
