PS5 — CHYP: Human-Centered AI Intake System

## Phase 1 TL;DR
Build a small, safe, high-precision scraper that discovers and classifies housing-related resources in San Francisco for homeless youth. The output must be a clean, deduplicated JSON catalog with metadata ready for downstream search, chat, and intake form-filling.

## Problem & Users
- **Problem**: Youth currently navigate fragmented, repetitive, and trauma-insensitive intake systems across agencies. Reliable links exist but are difficult to find, interpret, or trust.
- **Primary users**: Youth (13–24), caregivers, and outreach workers.
- **Secondary users**: Cross-system providers (government + nonprofits) who will consume the structured catalog.

## Phase 1 Objective
Seed a trustworthy SF housing directory (links + structured metadata) that can plug into an AI intake assistant. The immediate goal is a live, queryable database covering the full landscape of housing providers that serve homeless youth in San Francisco.
